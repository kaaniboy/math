\section{Successive Wins}

The three-set series containing two wins in a row  
are $WWW$, $WWL$, and $LWW$ (where $W$ is a win, 
and $L$ is a loss). Let $p$ be the probability that Elmer beats his 
father, and let $q$ be the probability that he 
beats the champion. 

Using the champion-father-champion 
ordering, the probability of two wins in a row is:

$$qpq + qp(1-q) + (1-q)pq = 2pq-q^2p$$

Using the father-champion-father ordering, 
the probability of two wins in a row is:
$$pqp + pq(1-p) + (1-p)qp = 2pq - p^2q$$

Since, $p > q$, we know that:
$$ p > q $$
$$ pq > q^2 $$
$$ p^2q > q^2p $$

It follows that $2pq - q^2p > 2pq - p^2q$. Thus, Elmer 
should choose the champion-father-champion ordering.
