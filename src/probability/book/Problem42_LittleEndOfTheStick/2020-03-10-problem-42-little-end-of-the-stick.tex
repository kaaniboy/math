\section{The Little End of the Stick}
\subsection{Problem}

(a) If a stick is broken in $2$ at random, what is the average 
length of the smaller piece?

(b) What is the average ratio of the smaller length to the 
larger?

\subsection{Part (a) Solution}

Clearly, the smaller piece will be no more than $\frac{1}{2}$ the 
length of the stick. Let $S$ be the length of the smaller piece, 
which follows a continuous uniform distribution over $[0, \frac{1}{2}]$.
Thus, the expected length is:

$$E[S] = \frac{0 + \frac{1}{2}}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$$

\subsection{Part (b) Solution}

To calculate the average ratio, we apply the 
definition of the expected value by integrating 
over the possible lengths of the smaller piece: 

$$\int_0^{\frac{1}{2}} \left(\frac{x}{1-x}\right) \frac{dx}{1/2}
= \ln{4} - 1 \approx 0.3863$$

The above integral is leasily solved with the 
substitution $u=1-x$, giving an average ratio 
of about $0.3863$.
