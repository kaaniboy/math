\section{Chuck-a-Luck}

In the Chuck-a-Luck game, a player chooses a number 
between $1$ and $6$, and then $3$ dice are thrown. 
If their number appears on one, two, or three 
of the dice, they win one, two, or three times their 
original stake, respectively, plus their original 
stake back. Otherwise, they lose their original stake.

Using the binomial distribution, we can easily calculate 
the expected loss in this game on a unit (\$$1$) stake. The 
probability of none of the dice landing the player's 
guess is:

$$ \binom{3}{0}(1/6)^0(5/6)^3 = \frac{125}{216} $$

The probability of $1$ of the dice landing the player's 
guess is:

$$ \binom{3}{1}(1/6)^1(5/6)^2 = \frac{25}{72} $$

In a similar fashion, the probabilities for the dice landing 
$2$ or $3$ of the player's guesses are $\frac{5}{72}$ and 
$\frac{1}{216}$, respectively.

Combining these probabilities, the expected result of playing 
the game on a unit stake is:

$$ \frac{25}{72}(1) + \frac{5}{72}(2) + \frac{1}{216}(3) 
+ \frac{125}{216}(-1) = -0.08$$

Thus, the player can expect to lose about $8$ cents on a 
unit stake in Chuck-a-Luck.
