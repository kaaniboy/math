\section{Faulty Coin}
\subsection{Problem}

You have $1000$ coins, one of which is faulty: it has a head on both sides.
You randomly draw a coin, and, without examining it, toss it $10$ times. As
it happens, you get $10$ heads in a row. What’s the probability that it’s the
faulty one?

\subsection{Solution}

Bayes theorem is useful for solving this problem. Let $P(F)$ represent 
the prior probability that the drawn coin is faulty. Let $P(H)$ represent 
the prior probability of the coin landing on heads $10$ times in a row. 

We can calculate $P(H)$ by considering the two possible cases for the 
drawn coin---it is either faulty or not:

$$P(H) = \frac{1}{1000}(1)+\frac{999}{1000}
\left( \frac{1}{2^{10}} \right) = \frac{2023}{1024000}$$

We trivially know that $P(F) = \frac{1}{1000}$, since only 
one coin is faulty. Additionally, we know $P(H|F) = 1$, since the 
faulty coin always lands on heads.

Inserting these values into Bayes' theorem gives the following solution:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
P(F|H) &= \frac{P(F)P(H|F)}{P(H)} \\
&= \left( \frac{1}{1000}\right) \left(\frac{1024000}{2023} \right) \\
&\approx 0.506
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
