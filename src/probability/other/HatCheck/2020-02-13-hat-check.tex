\section{Hat Check}
\subsection{Problem}

A hat-check girl receives $n$ hats from 
$n$ patrons, but forgets which hats belong  
to whom. So, she randomly disperses the hats 
back to the patrons.

What is the probability $p_n$ that nobody has their 
hat returned to them?

\subsection{Solution}

A \textit{derangement} is a permutation of a set 
such that no element remains in its original position.
The number of derangements for a set of size $n$ is 
denoted as $!n$. 

For this problem, each derangement represents a dispersal 
of hats such that nobody receives their hat back. Thus, 
the proportion of derangements among all possible 
permutations of the $n$ hats is the probability that 
nobody has their hat returned to them:

$$ p_n = \frac{!n}{n!} $$

For reasonably large $n$ ($n \geq 8$), $!n$ is very closely 
approximated by $!n = \frac{n!}{e}$. Applying this 
approximation gives the following:

$$ p_n = \frac{!n}{n!} = \frac{\frac{n!}{e}}{n!} = \frac{1}{e}$$
