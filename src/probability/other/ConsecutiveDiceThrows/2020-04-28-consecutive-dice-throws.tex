\section{Consecutive Dice Throws}
\subsection{Problem}

What is the expected number of times one must roll a fair dice before 
getting $2$ consecutive $6$'s?

\subsection{Solution}
According to the geometric distribution, we can expect $6$ rolls before 
landing the first $6$. At that point, there is a $\frac{1}{6}$ chance 
that the next roll is a $6$, which would result in two consecutive $6$'s. 
On the other hand, there is a $\frac{5}{6}$ chance of landing a number that is 
not $6$, at which point we must reset our count. This formulation can be 
represented by the following recurrence, where $X$ is a random variable 
representing the number of rolls for $2$ consecutive $6$'s:

$$E[X] = 6 + \frac{1}{6}(1) + \frac{5}{6}(1+E[X])$$
$$E[X] = 42$$

Thus, the expected number of rolls to land $2$ consecutive $6$'s is $42$.
