\section{Proof of $\sqrt{2}$ Irrationality}
Suppose to the contrary that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational. 
Then, there must exist two coprime integers $p$ and $q$ 
such that$\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}$. We can rearrange 
this equation as follows:

$$\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}$$
$$2q^2 = p^2$$

From the above it is clear that $p^2$ is even. It follows 
that $p$ is also even, since the square of any odd number 
is odd. Thus, we can substitute $p$ with $2k$, where $k$ 
is any integer:

$$2q^2 = p^2$$
$$2q^2 = 4k^2$$
$$q^2 = 2k^2$$

By a similar argument, we can again see that both $q^2$
and $q$ are even. The fact that both $p$ 
and $q$ are even contradicts the initial statement that 
the two are coprime. Thus, we have reached a contradiction, 
and $\sqrt{2}$ must be irrational.
