<p>How many trailing zeros does <span class="math inline">\(n!\)</span> have?</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>Consider a fairly small factorial, like <span class="math inline">\(10! = 3,628,800\)</span>, which has <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> trailing zeros. Is there an easy way to see why it has <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> trailing zeros without performing the multiplications directly?</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[10! = 10\times9\times8\times7\times6\times5\times4\times3\times2\times1\]</span></p>
<p>Looking at the above, we can see why <span class="math inline">\(10!\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> trailing zeros. Obviously, the factor <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> contributes <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> of these. The other trailing zero comes from the product of the factors <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, which also gives <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>.</p>
<p>This idea of counting factors that are multiples of <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> is a good initial approach. Among these, multiples of <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> immediately contribute a trailing zero, while the remaining multiples of <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> contribute a trailing zero when multiplied by an even factor. Since half of the numbers in the factorial’s expansion are even, there is always an even number to pair with a multiple of <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s apply this approach to <span class="math inline">\(15!\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[15! = 15\times14\times13\times12\times11\times
10\times9\times8\times7\times6\times5\times4\times3\times2\times1\]</span></p>
<p>This factorial contains <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> multiples of <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(15\)</span>), which gives a total of <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> trailing zeros. Performing the multiplications gives <span class="math inline">\(15! = 1,307,674,368,000\)</span>, which confirms the solution.</p>
<p>Now, let’s try applying the approach to <span class="math inline">\(25!\)</span>. We know the expansion of <span class="math inline">\(25!\)</span> contains <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> multiples of <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, which are <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(15\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(25\)</span>. Thus, applying our method gives <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> trailing zeros. In reality, however, <span class="math inline">\(25!\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> trailing zeros: <span class="math display">\[25!= 15,511,210,043,330,985,984,000,000\]</span></p>
<p>What gives? The issue is that one term in this factorial’s expansion is <span class="math inline">\(25\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\(5^2\)</span>), which contains two <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>s. Thus, it actually contributes <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> trailing zeros to the count instead of just <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. This shows us that we must account for powers of <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> specially. For example, <span class="math inline">\(5^3=125\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(5^4=625\)</span> contribute <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> trailing zeros, respectively.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we can easily represent this process mathematically. If we define <span class="math inline">\(z_n\)</span> as the number of trailing zeros for <span class="math inline">\(n!\)</span>, we can write the formula as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[z_n = \left\lfloor\frac{n}{5}\right\rfloor+ \left\lfloor\frac{n}{5^2}\right\rfloor+ 
\left\lfloor\frac{n}{5^3}\right\rfloor+ \left\lfloor\frac{n}{5^4}\right\rfloor+ \ldots\]</span></p>
<p>The above formula only needs to be extended to the largest product of <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> that is less than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. For example, for <span class="math inline">\(125!\)</span> we extend it to the <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span><sup>3rd</sup> term, which gives:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[z_{125} = \left\lfloor\frac{125}{5}\right\rfloor+ \left\lfloor\frac{125}{5^2}\right\rfloor+ 
\left\lfloor\frac{125}{5^3}\right\rfloor= 25 + 5 + 1 = 31\]</span></p>
