<h1 id="proof-of-sqrt2-irrationality">Proof of <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> Irrationality</h1>
<p>Suppose to the contrary that <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> is rational. Then, there must exist two coprime integers <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> such that<span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}\)</span>. We can rearrange this equation as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[2q^2 = p^2\]</span></p>
<p>From the above it is clear that <span class="math inline">\(p^2\)</span> is even. It follows that <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is also even, since the square of any odd number is odd. Thus, we can substitute <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(2k\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is any integer:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[2q^2 = p^2\]</span> <span class="math display">\[2q^2 = 4k^2\]</span> <span class="math display">\[q^2 = 2k^2\]</span></p>
<p>By a similar argument, we can again see that both <span class="math inline">\(q^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> are even. The fact that both <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> are even contradicts the initial statement that the two are coprime. Thus, we have reached a contradiction, and <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> must be irrational.</p>
