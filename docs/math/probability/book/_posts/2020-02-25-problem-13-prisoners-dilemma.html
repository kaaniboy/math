<h1 id="the-prisoners-dilemma">The Prisoner’s Dilemma</h1>
<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>Three prisoners, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, with apparently equally good records have applied for parole. The parole board has decided to release two of the three, and the prisoners know this but not which two. A warder friend of prisoner <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> knows who are to be released. Prisoner A realizes that it would be unethical to ask the warder if he, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, is to be released, but thinks of asking for the name of one prisoner other than himself who is to be released. He thinks that before he asks, his chances of release are <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{3}\)</span>. He thinks that if the warder says "<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> will be released", his own chances have now gone down to <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span>, because either <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> are to be released. And so <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> decides not to reduce his chances by asking. However, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is mistaken in his calculations. Explain.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>Prisoner <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>’s mistake is not considering the entire sample space of pairs of prisoners that could be released, which is <span class="math inline">\(\Omega = \{AB, AC, BC\}\)</span>. In the case of <span class="math inline">\(AB\)</span>, the warden will say that <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> will be released, and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> has a <span class="math inline">\(100\%\)</span> chance of release. Similarly, in the case of <span class="math inline">\(AC\)</span>, the warden will say that <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> will be released, and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> has a <span class="math inline">\(100\%\)</span> chance of release. In the case of <span class="math inline">\(BC\)</span>, the warden will say that either <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> will be released, and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> has a <span class="math inline">\(0\%\)</span> chance of release. Each outcome has a <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span> chance of occurring. When combined, this gives the overall chance of release with the warden’s statement as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(A\;Released) = \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)1 + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)1
+ \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)0 = \frac{2}{3}\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, asking the warden has no effect on prisoner <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>’s chances of being released.</p>
