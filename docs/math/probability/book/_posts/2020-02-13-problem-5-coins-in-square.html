<p>We would like to compute the probability of a <span class="math inline">\(3/4\)</span>-inch diameter coin landing on a table covered by a grid of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> inch squares without touching the edges of any square.</p>

</figure>
<p>To calculate this probability, consider a single square on the grid. Then, consider the center of the landed coin as a point in that square. In order for the coin to not be touching the square, the center of the coin must be within a <span class="math inline">\(1/4\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(1/4\)</span> area at the center of the square:</p>

</figure>
<p>Thus, for one grid square, the probability of the coin not touching an edge is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^2}{(1)^2} = \frac{1}{16}\]</span></p>
<p>When considering an arbitrarily large grid, this probability remains the same, since adding more squares to the grid does not affect the overall proportion of places the coin can land without touching an edge. Thus, the final answer is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{16}\)</span>.</p>
