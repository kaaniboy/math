<h1 id="successive-wins">Successive Wins</h1>
<p>The three-set series containing two wins in a row are <span class="math inline">\(WWW\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(WWL\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(LWW\)</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is a win, and <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is a loss). Let <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> be the probability that Elmer beats his father, and let <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> be the probability that he beats the champion.</p>
<p>Using the champion-father-champion ordering, the probability of two wins in a row is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[qpq + qp(1-q) + (1-q)pq = 2pq-q^2p\]</span></p>
<p>Using the father-champion-father ordering, the probability of two wins in a row is: <span class="math display">\[pqp + pq(1-p) + (1-p)qp = 2pq - p^2q\]</span></p>
<p>Since, <span class="math inline">\(p &gt; q\)</span>, we know that: <span class="math display">\[p &gt; q\]</span> <span class="math display">\[pq &gt; q^2\]</span> <span class="math display">\[p^2q &gt; q^2p\]</span></p>
<p>It follows that <span class="math inline">\(2pq - q^2p &gt; 2pq - p^2q\)</span>. Thus, Elmer should choose the champion-father-champion ordering.</p>
